# A Vampire Story 
 
# Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
This project is the result of our team’s elaboration on the framework of option two from the assignment prompt. From our last remaining brain cells, we present “A Vampire Story.” The concept of this project was to create a series of videos that follow the odd story of a student investigation into the sighting of a vampire on campus. We wanted to create a Camp infused video experience that felt spontaneous and student-made. As for the video’s website, we wanted to hone in on the investigative and performative undertones of the video, finding ways to incorporate both true crime and theater related framing in our interactivity. We hope that all viewers will enjoy the seriousness with which we pursued the absurdity of our project.  
 
# Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?
To keep our project organized, we worked in stages: 
Script and Shot list: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lpt9Ya5PP_zbjpq2Nif8bAZbrwT6R30XWbuhB4oeOG8/edit?usp=sharing
Linked above was our working script and shot list for the filming of this project. Influenced by our early plans for the website, we first decided the general framework of progression in the story (i.e. “the spotting,” “the pursuit”). Once we defined how the story would progress we generated ideas of what could happen in each scene with a focus on how we move from scene to scene with continuity. It was during the scripting process we decided that we wanted to make this project super campy, therefore, we also spent time generating jokes through the details of the plot and side characters. During the time spent compiling a shot list, we all had to get on the same page about how to envision the visuals of the film. In making the shots list we were primarily concerned with the angles of the camera (i.e. taking video of Noah the vampire from slightly below and of Dev from headon). We initially wanted to collect shots that gave a range of angles and  frame widths.  
Filming and Editing: During filming we had the opportunity to revise some of our initial decisions. Firstly, we decided to shoot the videos from an iphone instead of a traditional camera from the school. We made this decision because we had developed a character of an inept camera-girl to make it feel real-time and student-based. Later during filming we realized that we had too few people to be behind the camera filming at any one time and therefore amended our script so that Dev and an unknown cameraperson capture these events. In terms of editing, the reduced number of shot angles equated to these longer takes makes the film feel more like it was shot under this reactive, in the moment recording documentation of an incident. 
 
# Website:  As we knew that we wanted to create short clips plotted along a timeline from the very begin. 
 
 
 
 
# Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
As this was our first time working to create a video there was some oversight. We were able to see what was going on in the
